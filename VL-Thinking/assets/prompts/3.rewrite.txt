You will receive a snippet of text that references a “description” or “caption” of an image. Your task is to produce a **nearly identical** version of that text with **minimal** changes, focusing on the following:

1. **Replace references to “description” or “caption”** with wording that references **“the image.”**  
   - For example, “The description says...” could become “The image shows...”  
   - “The caption suggests...” could become “The image suggests...”  
   - Make sure the replacement sounds natural but does **not** otherwise change the meaning.  

2. **Preserve all line breaks, punctuation, and spacing** as much as possible, and make **no additional edits** outside of these replacements.

3. You should only output the rewritten content.
